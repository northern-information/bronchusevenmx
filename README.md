thinkin' (wo)man's deep code deep state music

## brainstorming

- lua for logic and sequencing
- supercollider for dsp and sampling
- tyler to create many loops and samples
- ryan to reverse engineer and rebuild in sc
- lots of sequins and lattice
- [y/n] thinking very little "generative" or "infinite" potential? should be "scored".
- long. 45-60 minutes. maybe a single track. maybe broken up into movements.
- 80% ambient, 20% dub, 3% magick
